# Fernwood-RS-Carwash Floorplan  

This project presents the **conceptual floorplan** of *Fernwood-RS-Carwash*, designed with both service and leisure in mind. The structure integrates two functional levels, making it more than just a typical carwash.  

## Overview  
- **First Floor – Carwash**  
  The ground level is dedicated to a full-service carwash. The layout is planned for efficient vehicle flow, proper drainage, and designated waiting areas for customers.  

- **Second Floor – Coffee Shop**  
  Above the carwash sits a planned coffee shop with a view of the river. This space aims to provide a comfortable and inviting environment where customers can relax while waiting for their vehicles or simply enjoy the scenery.  

## Key Features  
- Dual-purpose building: combining utility and social space.  
- Maximized land use with vertical integration.  
- Coffee shop placement offers scenic riverside views.  
- Designed with customer experience in mind: service + leisure.  

## Potential Applications

- Can serve as a model for other **multi-use service facilities**.  
- Enhances customer satisfaction by turning waiting time into quality time.  

## Future Improvements  
- Detailed interior layouts for the coffee shop.  
- Inclusion of green spaces and open-air seating.  
- Integration of eco-friendly water recycling for the carwash.
